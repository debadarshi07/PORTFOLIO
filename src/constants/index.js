export const HERO_CONTENT = `Welcome to my portfolio!
I’m a 3rd-year B.Tech Computer Science student specializing in web development, Data Science, and Machine Learning. My technical interests lie at the intersection of software engineering and intelligent systems, where I build scalable, high performance web apps and data-driven solutions.

I have hands-on experience across the tech stack from responsive front-end interfaces to optimized back-end architectures and enjoy applying statistical models and machine learning algorithms to solve complex real-world problems.

A key strength I bring is my ability to rapidly learn and adapt to emerging technologies, enabling me to stay current in a fast-evolving field. My work reflects a commitment to clean code, system design, and user-focused development.

Feel free to explore my projects—they highlight my journey of continuous technical growth and practical innovation.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `As a B.Tech Computer Science student, I have cultivated a fervent passion for Full Stack Web Development, which was sparked by my insatiable curiosity about technology and its potential to address real-world challenges. My journey in programming has led me to acquire proficiency in a variety of technologies, including the MERN, Java, Linux, C, and Python, as well as version control systems like Git. This diverse skill set allows me to seamlessly integrate both front-end and back-end development, crafting comprehensive web solutions.

Outside of coding, I am deeply intrigued by emerging technologies and the complexities of geopolitics, always eager to explore their interconnections and implications for society. I believe that a well-rounded perspective enhances my approach to problem-solving and innovation.`;
